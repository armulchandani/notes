The application 'notes' consists of a simple business function of user having notes. The application is built using RESTFull service and will support following API:

1. Retrieve all the notes of a user
2. Adding new note for user
3. Update existing note for a user
4. Delete an existing note for a user.  

A user could have many notes so a 1-n association exists between user & note.
